# Better db-error.php dropin for wordpress
This `db-error.php` enhances default "Database connection error page":

* It gives better connection error debugging for administrator when using wp-cli.
* It shows nice error message for end users.

The error message page is **currently only in Finnish** but we have plans for adding other languages as well.
